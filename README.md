### AgroMart

- Our project AgroMart is based on vegetable and fruit production where we produce them using Hydroponics method and provide services to customers on subscription based.

SDGs our project align with are Good Health and Well Being, and Zero Hunger.

### Problem Statement:  
By studying the United Nations SDGs our team felt that all the Goals are interconnected and cannot be completely eradicated while others are still taking place. Hunger is a challenge to humanity being poor is not just a bane but can incapacitate people to explore life and have a healthy life. Many people cannot afford to buy fruits and vegetables due to their increasing prices. Conventional farming also has lot of drawbacks and is affecting the environment in many ways.

### Solution: 

AgroMart is the pioneer in the commercial hydroponics industry. 
Hydroponics is the way forward for developing nations.
Hydroponics is where we grow vegetables and fruits without soil, fertilizers and with very less nutrient based water solution.

- Hydroponics with vertical farming method grown on your backyard or rooftop by us and those products can assure you health security.
- Food Security and Health Security to consumers.
- Hydroponics requires no soil enabling for the reuse of water
- Increases food production stability, providing higher yields
- Production increases 3 to 10 times in the same amount of space.


<b>Join us in the modern and sustainable Agro revolution</b>

Hydroponics is feasible as it decreasing the time between harvest and consumption increases the nutritional value of the end product. 

Hydroponics is credible as professional Hydroponic farmers and farm builders, designing practical, simple hydroponic agro solutions.

### Challenges we ran into:
It was difficult to draft the business model for the project and to calculate the values of some vegetable if we grow using Hydroponics. Also we ran into some UI related issues.
